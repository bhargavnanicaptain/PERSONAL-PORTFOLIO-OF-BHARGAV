            <h2>SMART RAILWAY PLATFORM WITH  PASSENGER SAFETY  GATES TO PREVENT LEVEL CROSSING USING IOT</h2>
            <p class="first-paragraph"><strong>ABSTRACT:</strong> Human safety is a major goal for Railways. The intention of this paper is to achieve automatic control at the level crossings when the arrival/departure of the train takes place replacing the manual gate control.<br>
                 The railway gate automatically is closed when a train passes through the railway crossing. When the train arrives at the station, the gate opening and closing is to be done using servo motors which are controlled by Arduino Uno.<br> In addition, with this the status of the gate will be given to the motorman well in advance which insures more safety from the accident. Buzzers are used to indicate the closing of gates for the people who are trying to cross the gate. <br>This system helps in avoiding the increased number of the accidents at level crossing in India. The hardware is supported by the Arduino C programming. The proposed system is more reliable and cost efficient.

            <h2>GARBAGE MONITORING AND AUTO ALERTING SYSTEM TO MUNICIPALITY USING IOT</h2>
            <p class="fourth-paragraph"><strong>Description:</strong> Because of urbanization, a lot of waste accumulates in major metropolitan towns and developed regions, and strong waste control is a major challenge confronted by municipalities, wherein the accumulated dirt must be well disposed of as soon as possible to keep the environment clean. When done manually, this work requires a large amount of manpower.<br> So, if you want to solve this problem we use an IoT technology-based project in which the device detects the amount of waste amassed within the bins and when the bin is full, it indicates to the concerned government to ease the packing containers and keep the environment clean. <br>This undertaking describes the advent of a smart garbage monitoring system that measures waste tiers in garbage bins in actual time and signals the municipality specifically through SMS.<br> An ultrasonic sensor for measuring bin degrees and a GPS module for retrieving bin area information is used in this task. GSM module to send the message to the concerned government, with a Node MCU to control the entire process. <br>When the waste bin is complete or almost complete, it is meant to generate and send SMS caution messages to the municipality so that the rubbish may be accumulated immediately. This could help the concerned government clean up the environment and keep it simple and tidy.
